<p>If you are reading this I figured out github and my brain stopped hurting.</p>
<p>I have never wanted to graduate more before in my life.</p>
<p>This has been a very interesting class, however for some reason github is making my life difficult.  I plan on conquering it and riding off into the sunset in total victory.  Github picked the wrong tired college student to mess with.  I'm sure it is actaully a lot easier to use than I am making it out to be.  It also turns out that computer code and dyslexia dont mix (as a proud dyslexic I can say this without sounding controversial).</p>

<p>^This is how github makes me feel sometimes.  This is also how the Nebraska football team makes me feel.</p>
<p style= "color:red; font-family: Arial"> Go Huskers, I am proud to be an American.  Many people think the Huskers are going to suck this year, especially after the BYU game.  I think that we got off to a rough start and that we will improve over the course of the season.  Husker fans are expecting too much, especially after the introduction of a new coaching staff to the program.  Bo did not pan out and that is sad but we must move on with our lives.  I am very worried about our defensive preformance this year.  I think if any part of our team will be our downfall it will be them for sure.</p>
